# Creating Multiple Sequences Alignments with deep reinforcement learning 

## Overview
This project implements a single-agent and multi-agent solution for Multi-Agent Systems (MSA). The MSA is designed to [briefly describe the purpose or goal of your project].

## Features
- Single-agent solution: [Brief description of the single-agent solution]
- Multi-agent solution: [Brief description of the multi-agent solution]
- [Add more features as necessary]

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/msa-project.git
    cd msa-project
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
### Single-agent Solution
1. Navigate to the `single_agent` directory:
    ```sh
    cd single_agent
    ```

2. Run the single-agent solution:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

### Multi-agent Solution
1. Navigate to the `multi_agent` directory:
    ```sh
    cd multi_agent
    ```

2. Run the multi-agent solution:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```
